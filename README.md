# This is a Timer

This is a simple Timer built using Tauri + React + Typescript + Vite.


This timer is designed to assist with focused studying and work, utilizing the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This timer will help you stay organized and maintain productivity by providing a structured approach to your tasks.
